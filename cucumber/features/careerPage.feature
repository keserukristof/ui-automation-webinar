Feature: EPAM job searching
  As a Job searcher
  I want to browser through EPAM Job offers by various criteria
  So I can find to best fitting offer for me

  Scenario Outline: Searching for a job - <PositonName>
    Given the career page is opened
    Then the logo should be visible
    And the cookie bar should be hidden
    And the search form should be visible

    When <City>, <Country> is selected in the location filter box
    Then <City> should be selected in the location filter box

    When <Department> is selected in the department filter box
    Then <Department> should be selected in the department filter box

    When the search button is clicked
    Then there should be a job offer for <PositionName> position
    And the location of the <PositionName> position should be <Country>

    When the apply button of the <PositionName> position is clicked on
    Then the description of the job offer should contain the <PositionName> position name

    Examples:
      | Country | City     | Department                | PositionName              |
      | Hungary | Debrecen | Software Test Engineering | Test Automation Engineer  |
      | Belarus | Minsk    | Software Architecture     | Architect                 |
